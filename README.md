# PSGalleryInfo
Display and search for top downloaded modules or scripts from the PowerShell Gallery.  By default, MicroSoft Corporation and PowerShell DSC author are excluded.      Output is displayed in a Out-GridView and selection of an entry will display the module's     or script's project web page, if one exists.      Module and script data is cached locally for a period of 8 hours, so repeated execution of     the command is very quick.      The script extends the work of Chris Hunt.     https://www.automatedops.com/blog/2017/04/28/bringing-the-community-forward/
